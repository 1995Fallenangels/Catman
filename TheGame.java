/**
 * Write a description of class TheGame here.
 * 
 * This is the code for the game 'Catman' I'm creating for my computer science assignment. Catman is inspired by the game Pacman.
 * In this game, a cat is being chased by dogs. When the cat gets caught by a dog, the cat loses 3 lives. The cat has 9 lives in total.
 * There will be fishes the cat can eat. 
 * There will need to be 4 main components that make up this game which is:
 * 1) a maze component. This draws the maze the cat and dogs walk through
 * 2) a component that moves the characters
 * 3) a scorekeeping component. This will show the score of the user
 * 4) a healthbar. This will show how many lives the kitten has left. The cat will have nine lives represented as hearts (because cats have 9 lives).
 * When the cat runs into a dog, the cat will lose 3 lives.
